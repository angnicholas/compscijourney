# My Pathway
[Back to home](/README.md)

## 2015-2019 (High school)
I took a bunch of Computer Science classes which introduced me to the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms as well as some applied areas (Data Science, Internet-of-Things, etc.) I did a bunch of small-scale (typically ~1k LOC) projects in robotics / ML / web as well - but honestly for the most part I still felt quite lost in terms of learning new technologies / reading documentation and such. Generally speaking these courses just got me interested into the field and weren't too in-depth. Most of it was in Python.

## 2020-2022 (Pre-uni)
Continued exploring CS-related topics during my time in military service, and got introduced to web development through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (Javascript track) (which I'd highly recommend!) that was my first "real" software development experience.  

After that, did an internship which primarily involved writing backend software (Django) and Machine Learning applications (Tensorflow/Pytorch) for business clients.  

## 2022-2024 (Uni)
Started my undergraduate CS degree in the University of Cambridge (currently in third year, as of October 2024). A good proportion of the course was an extension to what I had already been doing - in terms of learning how to program in more languages, using various systems, etc.  

The more novel part of my course involved an in-depth look into the "theoretical" side of things. "Theoretical" can be interpreted in two ways:
1. Being introduced to the sub-fields of Computer Science which are very mathematical in terms of making formal definitions and proving results. (Eg. The P vs NP Problem, complexity classes, computable functions, semantics of programming languages).
2. Learning how to formulate and analyse abstract models of computational "stuff" in general. For example: what's the best way to reason about how a user interacts with a webpage? Another example: models of distributed system behaviour (eg. Byzantine fault tolerance).

During the two years, I also did another two internships over the summer breaks, mainly involving writing backend logic and scripting code in Python. I also got my hands dirty with some deployment/AWS stuff (although I'm not sure if my services are still surviving...)
