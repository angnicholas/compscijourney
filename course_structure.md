# Course Structure

[Back to home](/)


## Year 1
- In total, there will be 12 Computer Science courses, all of which are compulsory (taking up 75\% of the grade)
- Each course typically runs for 1 term which will is (8-9) weeks, although some extend beyond a term
- Each course will contain anywhere between 8 to 24 hours of lectures in total. [This link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/part1a.html) shows the number of lecture hours - so for eg. if a course has 12 hours of lectures and runs for 8 weeks, it will mean on average around 1-2 hours of lectures per week
- Each course also typically includes 2-4 supervisions which are 1-hour long sessions with a supervisor (either a PhD student or faculty) where you go through the material in depth
    - Typically it is 2-3 students assigned to one supervisor
    - Usually there would be some work assigned, on average I'd say 2-3 hours of work for one supervision would be reasonable
- In addition there is the NST Mathematics module (which runs through the entire year) - and takes up 25\% of the grade if I remember correctly

### Assessment
- This is the [exam structure](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/exam-structure.pdf) (for all years) and [past exam papers](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/exams/pastpapers/)
- These are the [past exam papers](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergradnst/pastpapers) for NST Maths 
- 100\% of the year's grade is allocated to examinations, and your total mark for all papers will be summed up and weighted accordingly to get the final grade
- The degree class will then be determined by percentile cut-offs
- On top of that there are also graded practicals which are (pass/fail) - typically everyone passes as long as you submit your work on time

## Year 2
- Structure is quite similar to Year 1, there were more courses this time (17 examinable courses in total) - but without NST Maths the number of course hours is _roughly_ the same (although most people tend to find the Year 2 topics more challenging than NST Maths, since the latter overlaps slightly with/is a direct extension from A levels)
- Not all courses on the [course website](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2425/part1b.html) are examinable

### Assessment
- Similar to first year, except there is more freedom in terms of question choice (so you could revise really hard for some topics and drop a few)
